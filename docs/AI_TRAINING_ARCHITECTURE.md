# AI Music Generation Training Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the complete architecture for training proprietary AI music generation models with deep musical understanding.

## System Architecture

### 1. Data Preprocessing Pipeline

#### 1.1 Audio Feature Extraction (Already Implemented)
- **Source Separation**: Demucs (4 stems: vocals, drums, bass, other)
- **MIR Features**: BPM, key, tuning, sections, chords, beats
- **MP3 Metadata**: ID3 tags, album artwork
- **Musical Notation**: Per-stem transcription

#### 1.2 Music Theory Analysis (TO IMPLEMENT)
```python
# Harmonic Analysis
- Chord progressions with Roman numeral notation
- Key changes and modulations
- Harmonic rhythm (chord change frequency)
- Functional harmony (tonic, dominant, subdominant)
- Voice leading patterns
- Cadence detection (authentic, plagal, half, deceptive)

# Rhythmic Analysis
- Time signature detection
- Syncopation patterns
- Polyrhythm detection
- Groove templates
- Rhythmic complexity metrics
- Metric hierarchy (downbeats, strong/weak beats)

# Melodic Analysis
- Melodic contour (ascending, descending, arched)
- Interval patterns
- Scale detection (major, minor, pentatonic, blues, modal)
- Motif identification
- Phrase structure

# Form Analysis
- Song structure (verse, chorus, bridge, pre-chorus, outro)
- Repetition patterns
- Contrast and variation
- Section transitions
```

#### 1.3 Genre Convention Database
```python
# Genre-Specific Patterns
{
  "genre": "pop",
  "conventions": {
    "common_progressions": ["I-V-vi-IV", "vi-IV-I-V"],
    "typical_bpm_range": [100, 130],
    "common_structures": ["verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus"],
    "instrumentation": ["drums", "bass", "guitar", "vocals", "synth"],
    "rhythmic_patterns": ["four-on-the-floor", "syncopated-hi-hats"],
    "production_style": ["compressed", "bright", "punchy"]
  }
}
```

        class NotationCrossAttention:
            def forward(audio_latent, notation_tokens):
                # Query: Audio features
                Q = linear_q(audio_latent)
                
                # Key/Value: Notation embeddings
                K = linear_k(notation_tokens)  # [batch, seq_len, dim]
                V = linear_v(notation_tokens)
                
                # Attention weights (audio attends to notation)
                attn_weights = softmax(Q @ K.T / sqrt(dim))
                output = attn_weights @ V
                
                # This ensures generated audio follows notation
                return output
    
    Diffusion Process:
        T = 1000  # Diffusion steps
        for t in reverse(range(T)):
            # Denoise step
            noise_pred = unet(
                latent_t,  # Noisy latent
                t,  # Timestep
                notation_tokens,  # Cross-attention conditioning
                genre_embedding,  # Style conditioning
                production_params  # Mix characteristics
            )
            
            # Update latent (move towards clean audio)
            latent_t = scheduler.step(latent_t, noise_pred, t)

# üéµ AI-Powered Music Analysis & Generation Platform
## Expert Team Recruitment - Production Azure/.NET Project

---

## üìã Project Overview

**Project Title:** AI-Powered Music Analysis & Generation Platform (.NET + Azure)

**Objective:** Build a production-grade system that ingests MP3 files, analyzes musical structure (sections, chords, key, tempo, tuning), stores metadata in a queryable format, and generates new stems/loops (guitar, bass, drums, vocals) using state-of-the-art AI models. The entire system must be **scalable, secure, observable, and Azure-native**.

**Technology Stack:**
- **.NET 8.0** (Web API, Durable Functions, Background Workers)
- **Azure Cloud** (AKS, Durable Functions, Blob Storage, SQL Database, OpenAI)
- **Python ML** (Demucs, Essentia, madmom, PyTorch-based audio generation models)
- **Containers & Orchestration** (Docker, Kubernetes, GPU workloads)

**Budget:** ~$150K - $250K (depending on timeline and team size)  
**Timeline:** 12-16 weeks for MVP, 6+ months for production-ready platform  
**Location:** Remote-first (US/EU timezones preferred)

# Audio Flamingo + Bark Training Integration - Complete

## Overview
Successfully integrated Audio Flamingo audio understanding model into the analysis pipeline and created a comprehensive system for generating Bark training datasets from MP3 files and their stems.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Audio Flamingo Integration
- **Model**: Audio Flamingo 2 (1.5B parameters) for balanced performance
- **Capabilities**: Audio captioning, genre classification, mood detection, instrument identification
- **Runtime Installation**: Models downloaded at container startup to optimize build times
- **CPU Optimization**: Uses CPU-only PyTorch for efficient analysis without GPU requirements

### 2. Comprehensive Analysis Pipeline
- **Main Track Analysis**: Full MIR feature extraction + Audio Flamingo understanding
- **Stem-Specific Analysis**: Individual analysis of drums, bass, vocals, and harmonic instruments
- **Instrument-Specific Features**:
  - **Drums**: Onset detection, rhythm patterns, kick/snare/hihat presence
  - **Bass**: Pitch tracking, fundamental frequency analysis, sustain characteristics
  - **Vocals**: Formant analysis, vibrato detection, vocal quality assessment
  - **Harmonic Instruments**: Chord detection, sustain analysis, harmonic content

### 3. Bark Training Data Export System
- **Structured JSON Export**: Complete training datasets with metadata and prompts
- **Training Instructions**: Markdown files with usage guidelines and recommendations
- **Manifest Generation**: Batch training manifests for multiple audio files
- **Multi-Level Prompts**: Full track, individual stems, and multi-instrument scenarios

## File Structure

### Core Analysis Files
- `workers/analysis/audio_flamingo_service.py` - Audio Flamingo integration service
- `workers/analysis/analysis_service.py` - Enhanced analysis with Bark training preparation
- `workers/analysis/requirements.txt` - Updated dependencies (transformers, accelerate)
- `workers/analysis/Dockerfile` - Container setup with Audio Flamingo support

### New Methods Added

    async def initialize_model() - Model initialization with graceful fallback
    async def analyze_audio_content() - Comprehensive audio understanding
    async def _query_model() - Internal model querying with error handling
```

#### Enhanced Analysis Service (`analysis_service.py`)
```python
# Comprehensive analysis methods
async def analyze_stem_comprehensive() - Instrument-specific stem analysis
async def _prepare_stem_bark_training_data() - Bark training data for stems
async def _prepare_bark_training_data() - Main track Bark training data

# Export system
async def export_bark_training_dataset() - Complete dataset export
async def analyze_and_export_bark_dataset() - Full pipeline method
def _generate_bark_training_prompts() - Training prompt generation
def _create_bark_training_instructions() - Training documentation
def _create_training_manifest_entry() - Batch training manifests
```

## Usage

### Complete Analysis Pipeline
```python
# Analyze main MP3 + stems and export Bark training data
result = await analysis_service.analyze_and_export_bark_dataset(
    audio_path=Path("song.mp3"),
    stems_dir=Path("stems/"),
    output_dir=Path("bark_training/"),
    audio_file_id="song_001"
)
```

### Output Structure
```
bark_training/
├── bark_training_dataset_song_001.json    # Complete training dataset
├── training_instructions_song_001.md      # Training guidelines
└── manifest_entry                         # Batch training manifest
```

### Dataset JSON Structure
```json

  "dataset_metadata": {
    "audio_file_id": "song_001",
    "total_samples": 5,
    "main_track_duration": 180.5,
    "analysis_version": "1.0"
  },
  "main_track": {
    "audio_description": "Upbeat electronic dance music...",
    "style_prompt": "Electronic dance music in D major at 128 BPM...",
    "technical_prompt": "High dynamic range audio with strong bass...",
    "training_suitability": true
  },
  "stems": [
    {
      "stem_type": "drums",
      "audio_description": "Energetic drum pattern with prominent kick...",
      "technical_features": { "onset_density": 2.5, "rhythm_complexity": 0.8 }
    }
  ],

    }
  ]
}
```

## Training Recommendations

### For Bark Model Training
1. **Use Combined Prompts**: Primary text inputs for Bark training
2. **Apply Training Weights**: Balance full track vs. stem learning (1.0 for main, 0.7 for stems)
3. **Consider Technical Prompts**: Fine-tune audio characteristics
4. **Multi-Instrument Prompts**: Help with generalization across instruments

### Quality Assurance
- **Training Suitability Assessment**: Automatic quality checks for training readiness
- **Confidence Scores**: Analysis confidence metrics for sample selection
- **Technical Quality Metrics**: Dynamic range, spectral quality, and clarity assessments

## Container Status
- **Build Status**: ✅ Successfully building and running
- **Dependencies**: All required packages installed (transformers, accelerate, librosa)
- **Runtime Installation**: Audio Flamingo models download on first use
- **Health Check**: Service responding at http://localhost:8080/health

## Next Steps
1. **Upload MP3 files** through the UI for comprehensive analysis
2. **Review generated training datasets** in the bark_training output directory
3. **Use training instructions** to optimize Bark model training
4. **Process multiple files** using the batch training manifest system

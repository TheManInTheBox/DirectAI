## 🚧 What's REMAINING (5%)

### ❌ End-to-End Testing (ONLY REMAINING TASK)

**Status:** ⏳ **Not Started**

#### Test Scenarios Required:

##### 1. Upload & Analysis Flow
```
Steps:
1. Start Docker Compose (all services running)
2. Apply EF Core migration to database
3. Start .NET API
4. Run MAUI app on Windows
5. Drag MP3 file onto upload zone
6. Verify:
   ✓ File uploads successfully
   ✓ Progress indicator shows during upload
   ✓ File appears in Source Material Library
   ✓ Upload status shows "Uploaded successfully"
7. Click "Analyze" on card
8. Wait 30-60 seconds
9. Click refresh button
10. Verify:
    ✓ Card shows "✓ Analyzed" badge
    ✓ BPM, Key, Time Signature displayed
    ✓ "Generate Stems" button becomes available
```

**Database Verification:**
```sql
-- Check uploaded file
SELECT * FROM "AudioFiles";

-- Check analysis result
SELECT * FROM "AnalysisResults";

-- Check JAMS annotation in Blob Storage
-- Browse to: http://localhost:10000/devstoreaccount1/audio-files/
```

**Expected Analysis Output:**
- BPM: 120-180 (typical)
- Key: e.g., "C Major", "D Minor"
- Time Signature: e.g., "4/4", "3/4"
- Sections: verse, chorus, bridge
- Chords: progression with timing

##### 2. Single Stem Generation Flow
```
Steps:
1. Select analyzed file from Source Material Library
2. Click "🎸 Generate Stems" button
3. Confirm generation dialog
4. Verify:
   ✓ Status shows "Creating generation request..."
   ✓ Status updates to "✓ Generation started!"
5. Wait 3-5 minutes (MusicGen processing)
6. Click refresh button on Generated Music Library
7. Verify:
   ✓ 3 stems appear (guitar, bass, drums)
   ✓ Each stem shows duration and file size
   ✓ Created date/time is current
8. Click "⬇ Download" on a stem
9. Verify:
   ✓ File downloads to Documents/MusicPlatform/
   ✓ Status shows "Downloaded successfully!"
   ✓ WAV file is playable
```

**Database Verification:**
```sql
-- Check generation request
SELECT * FROM "GenerationRequests";

-- Check generated stems
SELECT * FROM "GeneratedStems";
```

##### 3. Multi-Select Batch Generation Flow
```
Steps:
1. Upload 3 MP3 files
2. Wait for analysis on all (1-3 minutes total)
3. Refresh Source Material Library
4. Click ☑ button to enter selection mode
5. Verify:
   ✓ Checkboxes appear on all analyzed cards
   ✓ Selection controls bar appears
6. Click "Select All"

    ✓ Selection mode auto-exits
11. Wait 10-15 minutes (3 files × 3 stems each)
12. Refresh Generated Music Library
13. Verify:
    ✓ 9 stems total (3 per file)
    ✓ All stems downloadable
```

##### 4. Error Handling Flow
```
Steps:
1. Upload invalid file (e.g., .txt renamed to .mp3)
2. Verify:
   ✓ Upload succeeds (API accepts file)
   ✓ Analysis fails gracefully
   ✓ Card shows error message
   ✓ Analysis button still available for retry

2. Upload very large file (>100MB)
3. Verify:
   ✓ Upload progress shows correctly
   ✓ API handles large files
   ✓ Analysis completes (may take longer)

3. Generate stems with no analysis
4. Verify:
   ✓ Generate button disabled/hidden
   ✓ User can't initiate generation
```

##### 5. Worker Logs Verification
```bash
# Analysis Worker Logs
docker logs music-analysis-worker -f

Expected Output:
- "Analyzing audio file: {filename}"
- "Running Demucs separation..."
- "Running Essentia analysis..."
- "Generating JAMS annotation..."
- "Analysis complete: {duration}s"

# Generation Worker Logs
docker logs music-generation-worker -f

Expected Output:
- "Generating stem: guitar"
- "Loading MusicGen model..."
- "Generating audio with MusicGen..."
- "Saving stem to blob storage..."
- "Generation complete: {duration}s"
```

##### 6. Blob Storage Verification
```
Tools:
- Azure Storage Explorer (connect to local Azurite)
- OR Browser: http://localhost:10000/devstoreaccount1/audio-files/

Verify:
✓ Uploaded MP3 files in audio-files container
✓ JAMS annotation files (.jams)
✓ Generated stem files (guitar.wav, bass.wav, drums.wav)
✓ File sizes and timestamps correct
```

## 🚀 Launch Commands

### Start Everything
```powershell
# 1. Start Docker services
docker-compose up -d

# 2. Check service health
docker-compose ps

# 3. Apply database migration (first time only)
cd src/MusicPlatform.Api
dotnet ef database update

# 4. Start API
dotnet run --project src/MusicPlatform.Api/MusicPlatform.Api.csproj

# 5. Start MAUI (new terminal)
cd src/MusicPlatform.Maui
dotnet run -f net9.0-windows10.0.19041.0
```

### View Logs
```powershell
# All services
docker-compose logs -f

# Specific service
docker logs music-analysis-worker -f
docker logs music-generation-worker -f
docker logs music-api -f
docker logs music-db -f
```

### Stop Everything
```powershell
# Stop containers (keep data)
docker-compose stop

# Stop and remove containers + networks
docker-compose down

# Nuclear option: remove volumes too (deletes database data)
docker-compose down -v
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Database migration fails
**Solution:**
```powershell
# Delete existing migrations
Remove-Item src/MusicPlatform.Api/Migrations/*.cs

# Recreate migration
cd src/MusicPlatform.Api
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
dotnet ef database update
```

### Issue: Azurite connection refused
**Solution:**
```powershell
# Check Azurite is running
docker ps | grep azurite

# Restart Azurite
docker-compose restart azurite

# Check connection string in appsettings.Development.json
```

### Issue: Analysis worker takes too long
**Expected:** 30-60 seconds per file  
**Actual:** 3-5 minutes

**Cause:** CPU-only processing (Demucs is slow without GPU)

**Solution:**
- Use shorter test files (< 1 minute)
- OR Enable GPU support (requires NVIDIA GPU + Docker GPU runtime)

### Issue: Generation worker fails to load model
**Error:** "Cannot download MusicGen model"

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Pre-download model manually
docker exec -it music-generation-worker bash
python -c "from transformers import AutoProcessor, MusicgenForConditionalGeneration; MusicgenForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained('facebook/musicgen-small')"
```

### Issue: MAUI app can't connect to API
**Error:** "Connection refused on localhost:5000"

**Solution:**
- Check API is running: `curl http://localhost:5000/api/audio/files`
- Check firewall isn't blocking port 5000
- Update `ApiSettings.cs` to use correct base URL

## 🧪 MVP Testing Roadmap

### Phase 1: Basic Upload & UI Testing (10 minutes) ✅ IN PROGRESS
**Status**: Partially complete - upload works, UI needs verification

**What to Test**:
1. ✅ Upload MP3 file via "Select Files" button
2. ⏳ Verify file appears in Source Material Library carousel
3. ⏳ Test multi-select mode (click ☑ button)
4. ⏳ Test "Select All" and "Deselect All" buttons
5. ⏳ Test library refresh button (⟳)

**Expected Results**:
- File card displays: filename, file size, duration, upload timestamp
- Status badge shows "Not Analyzed" (red/gray)
- Blue "🔬 Analyze" button is visible
- Multi-select checkboxes appear when in selection mode

**How to Resume**:
```powershell
# Terminal 1: Start API
cd src\MusicPlatform.Api
dotnet run

# Terminal 2: Start MAUI (if not running)
cd src\MusicPlatform.Maui
dotnet run -f net9.0-windows10.0.19041.0
```

---

### Phase 2: Analysis Testing (20 minutes) ⏳ BLOCKED
**Status**: Blocked - Requires Python analysis worker

**Prerequisites**:
```powershell
# Build analysis worker (takes ~10 minutes due to C++ compilation)
docker-compose build analysis

# Start analysis worker
docker-compose up -d analysis
```

**What to Test**:
1. Click "🔬 Analyze" button on uploaded file
2. Wait 30-90 seconds for analysis to complete
3. Click refresh button (⟳) to reload library
4. Verify analysis results display:
   - BPM (e.g., "120.5 BPM")
   - Musical Key (e.g., "C#")
   - Time Signature (e.g., "4/4")
5. Status badge changes to "✓ Analyzed" (green)

**Expected Database Records**:
```sql
-- Check analysis results
SELECT * FROM "AnalysisResults";
-- Should show: AudioFileId, Bpm, MusicalKey, Mode, Tuning, AnalyzedAt
```

**Troubleshooting**:
- If stuck "Analyzing": Check `docker logs music-analysis`
- If analysis fails: Worker may need GPU support (CPU fallback available)

---

### Phase 3: Single Stem Generation (15 minutes) ⏳ BLOCKED
**Status**: Blocked - Requires Python generation worker

**Prerequisites**:
```powershell
# Build generation worker (takes ~10 minutes)
docker-compose build generation

# Start generation worker
docker-compose up -d generation
```

**What to Test**:
1. Click "🎸 Generate Stems" on an analyzed file
2. Confirm generation dialog
3. Wait 3-5 minutes for processing
4. Navigate to "Generated Music Library" tab
5. Verify 3 stems appear:
   - Guitar stem
   - Bass stem
   - Drums stem
6. Click "⬇ Download" on one stem
7. Verify WAV file saved to: `Documents\MusicPlatform\`

**Expected Results**:
- Each stem shows: type, duration, file size, generation timestamp
- Download saves to local filesystem
- Status message shows "✓ Downloaded"

---

### Phase 4: Multi-Select Batch Generation (20 minutes) ⏳ BLOCKED
**Status**: Blocked - Requires workers + multiple analyzed files

**What to Test**:
1. Upload 2-3 MP3 files
2. Analyze all files (click Analyze on each)
3. Wait for all analyses to complete
4. Click ☑ button to enter selection mode
5. Click "Select All" button
6. Click "🎸 Generate from Selected" button
7. Confirm batch generation dialog
8. Wait 10-15 minutes for processing
9. Verify all stems generated (9 total: 3 per file)

**Expected Results**:
- Batch generation starts for all selected files
- Progress can be tracked in "Generated Music Library"
- All stems become available for download
- Selection mode auto-exits after generation starts

---

### Phase 5: Error Handling & Edge Cases (10 minutes) ⏳ NOT STARTED
**What to Test**:
1. **Invalid File Upload**: Try uploading .txt or .jpg file
   - Expected: Error message "Only audio files are supported"
2. **Large File Upload**: Try uploading 200+ MB file
   - Expected: Error message "File size exceeds 100 MB limit"
3. **Generate Without Analysis**: Try to generate from unanalyzed file
   - Expected: Button is disabled or shows error
4. **Network Interruption**: Stop API while MAUI is running
   - Expected: Graceful error message "Error loading source library"
5. **Worker Crash**: Stop worker during processing
   - Expected: Status updates to "Failed" with error message

---

### Phase 6: Data Verification (5 minutes) ⏳ NOT STARTED
**What to Test**:

**Database Verification**:
```powershell
# Check all tables
docker exec -it music-db psql -U postgres -d musicplatform -c "SELECT * FROM \"AudioFiles\";"
docker exec -it music-db psql -U postgres -d musicplatform -c "SELECT * FROM \"AnalysisResults\";"
docker exec -it music-db psql -U postgres -d musicplatform -c "SELECT * FROM \"GenerationRequests\";"
docker exec -it music-db psql -U postgres -d musicplatform -c "SELECT * FROM \"GeneratedStems\";"
```

**Blob Storage Verification**:
- Install Azure Storage Explorer
- Connect to: `DefaultEndpointsProtocol=http;AccountName=devstoreaccount1;AccountKey=Eby8vdM02xNOcqFlqUwJPLlmEtlCDXJ1OUzFT50uSRZ6IlfIlKAJQpC6ZKm8UGE82UWkr+mKFPZsKlPL1TK7Tw==;BlobEndpoint=http://127.0.0.1:10000/devstoreaccount1;`
- Navigate to `audio-files` container
- Verify uploaded files are present

**Worker Logs**:
```powershell
# Check analysis worker logs
docker logs music-analysis --tail 50

# Check generation worker logs
docker logs music-generation --tail 50
```

## 📝 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Session Issues (Fixed):
- ✅ Port mismatch (5168 vs 5000) - FIXED
- ✅ DTO property name mismatch - FIXED
- ✅ Enum serialization issue - FIXED
- ✅ 404 exception handling - FIXED

### Outstanding Issues:
1. **System.Text.Json vulnerability warning** (version 8.0.0)
   - Impact: Low (development only)
   - Fix: Update to latest System.Text.Json version

2. **Workers not built**
   - Impact: High (blocks analysis/generation testing)
   - Fix: Run `docker-compose build analysis generation`

3. **API not running**
   - Impact: High (MAUI can't connect)
   - Fix: Run `dotnet run` in src/MusicPlatform.Api

4. **Drag-and-drop not implemented**
   - Impact: Low (Select Files button works)
   - Fix: Add platform-specific drag-drop handlers

### Performance Notes:
- Worker builds take 10-15 minutes (C++ compilation for audio libraries)
- Analysis takes 30-90 seconds per file
- Generation takes 1-3 minutes per stem (3-5 min total per file)
- Large file uploads (>10MB) may take 10-20 seconds

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **DTO Mapping**: Client and server DTOs must match exactly (property names, types)
2. **Enum Serialization**: .NET defaults to numeric enums in JSON; use JsonStringEnumConverter
3. **Error Handling**: 404s should return null, not throw exceptions
4. **Port Configuration**: Ensure launchSettings.json matches client expectations
5. **Worker Dependencies**: Python audio libraries require C++ compilers (slow builds)
6. **SQL Compatibility**: SQL Server syntax doesn't work with PostgreSQL (use EF migrations)

## ✅ Recommendation

**I recommend Path A (Quick UI Verification) as the next step:**

1. It only takes 5 minutes
2. Confirms the fixes we made today are working
3. Validates UI/API integration
4. Your uploaded file should now appear in the library
5. You can then decide whether to invest 20 minutes in building workers

**Commands to run**:
```powershell
# Terminal 1: Start API
cd src\MusicPlatform.Api
dotnet run

# Wait for "Now listening on: http://localhost:5000"

# Terminal 2: Start/Restart MAUI
cd src\MusicPlatform.Maui
dotnet run -f net9.0-windows10.0.19041.0
```

Once MAUI opens, click the **⟳ Refresh button** next to "Source Material Library" and you should see your "down in a hole.mp3" file appear! 🎵

Let me know which path you'd like to take!
